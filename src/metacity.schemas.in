          The keybinding used to move focus backwards between windows
          of an application without a popup window. Holding "shift"
          together with this binding makes the direction go forward again.

          The format looks like "&lt;Control&gt;a" or
          "&lt;Shift&gt;&lt;Alt&gt;F1".

          The parser is fairly liberal and allows lower or upper case,
          and also abbreviations such as "&lt;Ctl&gt;" and
          "&lt;Ctrl&gt;". If you set the option to the special string
          "disabled", then there will be no keybinding for this
          action.

          If true, then Metacity works in terms of applications rather than
          windows. The concept is a bit abstract, but in general an
          application-based setup is more like the Mac and less like
          Windows. When you focus a window in application-based mode, all
          the windows in the application will be raised. Also, in
          application-based mode, focus clicks are not passed through to
          windows in other applications. Application-based mode is,
          however, largely unimplemented at the moment.
